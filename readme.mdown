# Partyvator
## Physical Computing Midterm Fall 2012

Pop-up movement controlled music & light party in an elevator. 

### Status

November 12 2012 

This code & guide reflects the project as of the time it was presented for a physical computing class at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program.

### Physical Components
 - [ADXL335 triple-axis accelerometer](http://www.adafruit.com/products/163)
 - [Digital Addressable RBG LED Strip](http://www.adafruit.com/products/306)
 - 2x [Arduino Uno or equivalent](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno)
 - Battery operated speaker
 - Battery power supply for lights (such as 6v lantern batteries & a voltage regulator)
 - Computer running Processing

### Known Issues
  - Arduino won't control full 5m LPD8806 strip with current noise code
  - No time-out function to prevent runaway sequences when elevator motion end isn't detected

### Next Steps
 - Allow for random or time-of-day based music/light segments
 - Update Arduino code to be able to run a full 5m strip with noise based lighting effects
 - Write code for elevator movement logic for Arduino
 - Arduino to Arduino serial communication (eliminate multiple USB connections to computer)
 - Eliminate computer from experience using MP3 shield for Arduino [investigating rMP3](http://www.roguerobotics.com/products/electronics/rmp3)
